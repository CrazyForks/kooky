/// twice here:
///
///   * cost — preexec runs before EVERY command, so a `kooky-hook` spawn there
///     sits on the critical path between the user's Return and the command
///     actually starting (measured ~8ms of fork + Swift runtime startup per
///     command). A `printf` costs nothing.
///   * ordering — the exit status arrives as OSC 133;D on this same stream, so
///     the text is guaranteed to land before the result it labels. A socket
///     and the byte stream are two transports with no ordering between them,
///     which let a fast command's result render against stale text.
///
/// Wire title shape:
///   kooky-command:<command line>
///
/// Delivered via OSC 2 and intercepted before it becomes a visible tab title.
