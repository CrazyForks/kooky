# Changelog

Notable changes per release. Tagged commits use `vX.Y.Z` shortform.

## v0.18.2 — 2026-05-27

- Paste a file or image — copy a file in Finder (Cmd+C) and Cmd+V into kooky now pastes the full file path instead of just the filename, so Claude / Codex / Cursor can read it as an argument.
- Paste a screenshot — take a screenshot to the clipboard (Cmd+Ctrl+Shift+4), Cmd+V into kooky, and the image gets saved to `~/Library/Caches/kooky/pastes/` with its path pasted into the terminal. Drop a screenshot straight into a Claude prompt with no save-to-disk detour. (Resolves #15.)

## v0.18.1 — 2026-05-27

- Worktree sidebar polish — worktree rows now show a branch badge in their subtitle, source rows reveal a hover-only chevron for collapsing the worktree group, and the disclosure no longer steals a leading column from the (already narrow) sidebar.
- Right-click a worktree → "Go to Source Workspace" jumps back to the source repo. Right-click a source → "Refresh Worktrees" picks up worktrees you created in another terminal without restarting kooky.
- Closing a worktree now also cleans up its branch — `git branch -d` runs after `git worktree remove`. Merged branches go away (next worktree of the same name builds cleanly); unmerged branches stay (git itself refuses, no data loss). Reads the worktree's real current branch from git at delete time, so `git switch`ing inside the worktree no longer leaves the wrong branch behind.
- "Create Worktree…" sheet opens noticeably faster (git enumeration runs in parallel), and the existing-branch picker hides itself when every local branch is already checked out somewhere.
- Worktrees you created from the command line now spawn with your default agent (the one you picked in Settings → Agents) instead of a plain Terminal.

## v0.18.0 — 2026-05-26

- **Git worktrees** — right-click a git workspace → "Create Worktree…" to spin one up on a new branch (or check out an existing one). Each worktree gets its own sidebar entry nested under its source repo, its own tabs, and its own agent — work on a feature branch with Claude without touching what's running on main. Closing a worktree deletes the directory; closing a source repo removes its whole worktree group in one confirm. Worktrees you create from the command line show up automatically next launch.

## v0.17.0 — 2026-05-26

- **Theme picker** — choose a theme in Settings. Theme changes apply immediately across the terminal and the whole window.

## v0.16.3 — 2026-05-25

- **Pane zoom (⌘⇧E)** — expand the active pane to fill the workspace; the other panes slide off-screen but their processes keep running. Toggle from ⌘⇧E, the zoom button in each pane's bottom status bar, the View menu, or right-click → "Zoom Pane".

## v0.16.2 — 2026-05-25

- **Settings → Status Bar** — drag to reorder the pane bottom status bar's slots (Python venv / Node version / Proxy / Git branch / Git diff), toggle individual ones off, or hide the whole row. Reset to defaults if you change your mind.

## v0.16.1 — 2026-05-25

- Fixed the Quick Open search pill overlapping the sidebar toggle when the window was dragged narrow. The pill now stays in the drag-handle area and hides automatically when there isn't room for it — ⌘P and the File menu still open the palette.

## v0.16.0 — 2026-05-25

- **Quick Open (⌘P)** — fuzzy-search across every window's workspaces and tabs, plus every visible agent and Terminal preset. Type to filter, ↑↓ to navigate, Enter to jump; clicking a workspace or tab focuses its owning window, picking an agent or preset spawns a new tab with it. Triggers from ⌘P or the search pill in the top chrome.

## v0.15.0 — 2026-05-25

- **Terminal presets** — define "Terminal at <path>" entries that show up in the `+` menu, each opening a new tab at a fixed folder regardless of the active workspace. Configure under Settings → Terminals: name + path (with `~/foo` shorthand or a folder picker), drag to reorder, toggle visibility, delete. Handy when you keep jumping to the same project folders.
- Settings sidebar reorganized — first category renamed `General` (was `Terminal`) to make room for the new `Terminals` category in between. The `default-new-tab` picker moved to `General` since it now controls both presets and agents.

## v0.14.4 — 2026-05-24

- File → Open Folder… (⌘O) opens any folder as a new workspace.

## v0.14.3 — 2026-05-23

- Drag a folder from Finder onto the sidebar to open it as a new workspace.

## v0.14.2 — 2026-05-23

- Right-click any tab → "Move to New Window" sends it to its own new window — the terminal, scrollback, and any running process all come along.

## v0.14.1 — 2026-05-22

- Drag a tab from one window's tab bar onto another window's to move it across — the terminal, its scrollback, and any running process all come with it.

## v0.14.0 — 2026-05-22

- Multiple windows — press ⌘⇧N to open a new window. Each window keeps its own workspaces, tabs, and sidebar, and every open window is restored when you relaunch kooky.

## v0.13.0 — 2026-05-22

- Custom agents based on Claude Code can now carry their own environment variables — set `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` in a custom agent's new `env` field (Settings → Agents) to point it at a Claude-compatible mirror or proxy.

## v0.12.4 — 2026-05-21

- Fixed: arrow keys in `vim` (and other full-screen programs) now work over SSH to older remote machines.

## v0.12.3 — 2026-05-21

- The tab and sidebar name now follow the terminal title — `ssh` into a remote host and the tab shows its `user@host` instead of the local folder, then reverts when you exit.

## v0.12.2 — 2026-05-20

- Antigravity CLI joins the agent menu — Google's Go-based successor to Gemini CLI.
- Fixed: picking Antigravity from the `+` menu when only the IDE is installed now surfaces a clear CLI install hint instead of accidentally opening the IDE app.

## v0.12.1 — 2026-05-19

- Check for Updates in the Kooky menu — see what's new and download the latest DMG in one click.

## v0.12.0 — 2026-05-19

## v0.11.6 — 2026-05-18

## v0.11.5 — 2026-05-18

- Fixed: when a long input wraps to a second line, the first line no longer disappears.

## v0.11.4 — 2026-05-18

- Fixed: Chinese / Japanese / Korean IME candidate window now shows right under the cursor instead of flying off-screen.

## v0.11.3 — 2026-05-16

- Drag a file or folder from Finder onto any kooky terminal pane → its path drops in at the cursor. Multi-file drag = space-separated paths.

- Click anywhere on your zsh prompt to jump the cursor there.

## v0.11.1 — 2026-05-15

- Fixed: right-clicking selections that start with `-` no longer crashes the agent.

- Fixed: right-clicking inside an inactive split now activates that pane first.

## v0.11.0 — 2026-05-15

- Right-click selection → "Ask <agent>". Select any text in a terminal, right-click, pick an agent → a new tab spawns with the selection as the first prompt.

## v0.10.8 — 2026-05-15

- Claude conversations resume across kooky restarts. Quit mid-conversation → next launch picks up where you left off.
- Settings → Agents → `resume-conversation-when-reopen` toggle.

## v0.10.7 — 2026-05-15

- GitHub Copilot tabs now show the mid-run "attention" dot.

## v0.10.6 — 2026-05-15

- Custom agents can inherit from a builtin — pick **Claude Code** as the base and your custom (e.g. "Claude Opus") inherits the icon, brand tint, and lifecycle tracking.
- Fixed: custom-based-on-Claude tabs now revert to Terminal when the agent exits.

## v0.10.5 — 2026-05-15

- Define your own agent. Settings → Agents → `+ add custom agent` wires any CLI as a first-class kooky agent.

- GitHub Copilot CLI joins the agent menu.

## v0.10.3 — 2026-05-15
